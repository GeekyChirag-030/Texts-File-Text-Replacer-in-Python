# Texts-File-Text-Replacer-in-Python


The Text File Text Replacer project is a Python application that allows users to replace specific text within a text file. 
The project utilizes the Tkinter library for its user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and use the application.

The application begins by prompting the user to select a text file to open. The user can select any type of text file, including 
.txt, .py, .jpg and .png files but Main Use of Txt Files Only. Once the file is selected, the application displays the contents of 
the file in a text widget for the user to view.

The user is then prompted to enter the text they wish to replace, as well as the replacement text, in the format of "old text, new text" 
in an entry widget. Once the user has entered this information, they can press the "Submit" button which will then execute the replacement 
in the text file. The user can then view the updated text file in the text widget.

The application also provides the functionality to save the modified file. The user can press the "Save" button.The file will be saved 
with the updated text.

The project makes use of the "with" statement in Python, which is used to automatically close the file after the block of code within the "with" 
statement is executed. This ensures that the file is properly closed and resources are freed up, even if an exception is thrown.


Additionally, the project also uses the "bind" method, which is used to associate an event with a callback function. In this project, it is used to 
bind the "Return" key to the "Submit" button, allowing the user to press "Return" instead of clicking the "Submit" button.

Overall, the Text File Text Replacer project is a useful tool for anyone who needs to make bulk replacements within a text file. 
Its user-friendly interface and efficient functionality make it a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.
